HW 4
Name: Iha Chikkala Email: chikkala@usc.edu

Compile:
Equal Paths: make equalpaths_tests
             ./equalpaths_tests
BST: make bst_tests
     ./bst_tests

AVL: make avl_tests
     ./avl_tests

I changed the bst-test file we were given to test individual cases from bst_tests and avl_tests.
Thus, it will look very different from the file we were given, but I kept those changes 
to keep a tab on the test cases that gave me trouble in case something stopped working.
